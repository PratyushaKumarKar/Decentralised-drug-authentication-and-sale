# Decentralised-drug-authentication-and-sale
This dapp aims to make fraudulent drug transactions and corruption in the system a thing of the past ! A proof-of-stake system ensures that all transactions are tamper proof and unique and can be cross verified at any moment if its needed. Any extra drugs outside the blockchain will be considered illegitimate and hence action can be taken. 
This dapp is based on the celo blockchain for its high transaction throughput and scalability on mobile platforms
Customers can enter this app directly via their phone numbers hence making the barrier of entry low for customers
Each manufacturer , distributor , hospital and pharma need to register into the blockchain and own a certain amount of celo coins in order to begin transactions.
Once a transaction takes place, its registered into the chain.
Each drug has its own unique serial number that is transferred onto the distributor once it buys from the manufacturer (just like a NFT , but not exactly )
Hospitals or Pharma can reach out to the distributors and manufacturers via their profiles on the app and request drugs from them.
This serial number transfers from distributor to the registered hospital or pharma once RFID or Bar code scanning verifies the logistics transfer. 
The distributors , manufacturers , hospitals and pharmas , all can put an auction for their drugs on the app  ( all sellers must have their KYC and IDs public for maximum transperancy. 
The customers can now choose to buy from any of these entities after logging in with their IDs or Phone numbers. They have to first buy celo coins and then proceed to buy the required medicine or drugs for the cheapest auctioned price they can find for the same on the app.
Once a customer chooses to buy something , they can initiate a transaction and pay the price along with the gas fees. ( Note that every transaction in the chain be it manufacturer to distributor , or distributor to pharma , all will have the actual drug valuation + gas fees included into it. Taxation is subject to change from country to country )
Once the drug reaches the customer and is verified via RFID or any other verification measures accepted by the industry , the transaction chain will be closed with all recorded data.
